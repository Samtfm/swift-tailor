# Swift Tailor

## Background

Fitting clothes is hard. measuring yourself is awkward. Swift Tailor aims to change that! Using computer vision software, this web-app will generate basic clothing measurements from user-submitted photos. It will then display a scaled sewing pattern using these measurements. As a proof of concept, we will create a T shirt model, using the measurements of arm width, torso width, and torso height.
Applications of this tool include DIY fashion as well as integration with a clothing manufacturer for custom fitted clothes.

## MVP Features

- [ ] train up a model to detect body parts
- [ ] allow users to upload or take photos
- [ ] measure detected body parts using trackingJS
- [ ] generate and display shirt pattern as downloadable image
